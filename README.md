Hi, I'm Andre :) I work with R&D in topics broadly related to machine learning, privacy and healthcare.
I'm currently a senior researcher at Microsoft, working remotely from Brazil. In the past few years I've also been:

👨‍🔬 a data scientist working in healthcare at [Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein](https://www.einstein.br), in São Paulo, Brazil (2020-2021)  
👨‍💻 a machine learning scientist working with privacy-preserving machine learning at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com), in Paris, France (2018-2020)  
👨‍🎓 a postdoc working with approximate Bayesian inference at ENS/CEA/Inria (mostly with [Florent](https://florentkrzakala.com/) and [Lenka](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova)), in Paris, France (2015-2018)  

Among repos that I contribute to, there are a couple that are up-to-date:

- [microsoft/msrflute](https://github.com/microsoft/msrflute): federated learning simulation platform developed by our team at Microsoft
- [microsoft/dp-transformers](https://github.com/microsoft/dp-transformers): train differentially-private transformers by combining Opacus and 🤗 Transformers

Otherwise, most of them are kind of old, and related to work I did either at Owkin or during my postdoc. In particular:

- [owkin/grad-cnns](https://github.com/owkin/grad-cnns/tree/master/code): speeding up per-sample computations in CNNs, useful for differentially-private learning <sub>(cf. [2020 TPDP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06015))</sub>  
- [sphinxteam/dnner](https://github.com/sphinxteam/dnner/tree/master/dnner): computing mutual informations in deep neural networks <sub>(cf. [2018 NeurIPS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09785))</sub>  
- [sphinxteam/AMP_tutorial](https://github.com/sphinxteam/AMP_tutorial): notebooks about approximate message-passing <sub>(tutorial during [Florent and Lenka's course at Duke](https://sphinxteam.github.io/DukeLecture2018/))</sub>  
- [amanoel/twamp](https://github.com/amanoel/twamp): approximate message-passing + non-separable penalties <sub>(cf. [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06304))</sub>
